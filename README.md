# #BB11 Create an Arduino Library
We use libraries all the time - even the Arduino framework is a library!

Writing a library is straightforward if you follow the simple pattern that I demo here. I show you a Real World library that controls a bit of hardware that I had on my workbench - but you can write one for ANY piece of hardware.

We'll even talk about elephants (the one in the room) and why we should not be fearful about simple things like 'objects' - watch the video and judge for yourself. ðŸ˜‰

Yes, a library can take the complexity of coding away from your sketch so that it (and future ones) "just work" by calling a library.
